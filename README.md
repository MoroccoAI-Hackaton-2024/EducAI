# Student-Centered Personalized Learning Solution

## Abstract

### Background and Problem Statement
The lack of personalized learning hampers studentsâ€™ ability to overcome gaps in understanding, leading to burnout and high dropout rates. The current models of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) often misdiagnose student needs and focus too heavily on domain-specific expertise.

### Impact and Proposed Solution
Our solution combines accurate student modeling with Bloom's Taxonomy to support both student autonomy and teacher evaluation, creating an adaptable and scalable system for personalized learning.

### Project Outcomes and Deliverables
- A student model framework adaptable across subjects and education levels.
- A system using Bloom's Taxonomy to guide metacognitive learning.
- A tool to empower students and support teachers in assessment.
