I'm sorry, but I don't have access to the specific input data containing the scores for each subquestion and taxonomy level that you mentioned. Without that data, I'm unable to provide the analysis and recommendations you are looking for. If you can provide the data, I'd be happy to assist with analyzing the scores and recommending metacognitive strategies for improvement.
